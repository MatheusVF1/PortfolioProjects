## Project 3 - Nashville Housing Data Cleaning (SQL)

**Description:**  
This project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL Server**, based on the Nashville Housing dataset.  
The goal was to transform a raw and inconsistent dataset into a well-structured and analysis-ready table through a series of **SQL transformations and best practices**.

**Objectives:**
- Standardize date formats  
- Populate missing address values using joins  
- Split complex address fields into individual columns (Address, City, State)  
- Normalize categorical values (e.g., converting "Y"/"N" to "Yes"/"No")  
- Identify and remove duplicate records  
- Drop unused columns safely using a temporary table  

**Files Included:**
- 📄 `Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Queries.sql` → Full SQL script with all cleaning steps  
- 🧾 `Nashville Housing Data.xlsx` → Original dataset used in this project
