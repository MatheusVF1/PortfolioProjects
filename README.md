# 💼 Portfolio Projects

Welcome to my **Portfolio Projects** repository!  
Here I store all my data analysis projects — each one contained in its own folder, with all datasets, SQL queries, notebooks, and other resources used during development.

This repository is a collection of studies and end-to-end projects created to explore **real-world data**, improve my **data analysis, SQL, and visualization** skills, and demonstrate my **problem-solving approach** using data.

## 📊 Project 1 - COVID Data Analysis

**Description:**  
This project explores the impact of COVID-19 worldwide using real data from **Our World in Data**.  
The analysis was performed in **SQL Server**, combining two datasets:
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`

**Objectives:**
- Understand infection and death trends across countries and continents  
- Analyze the relationship between population, total cases, and total deaths  
- Evaluate global vaccination progress over time  
- Generate insights through queries using aggregate functions, CTEs, temporary tables, and window functions

**Main Skills Used:**
- SQL (CTEs, Joins, Aggregations, Views, Temp Tables, Window Functions)  
- Data cleaning and exploration  
- Analytical thinking and data storytelling  

**Files Included:**
- `COVID - Data Exploration.sql` → Main SQL script with all analyses  
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx` → Dataset containing daily COVID death and case records  
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx` → Dataset containing global vaccination data  

**Key Insights:**
- Identification of countries with the highest infection and death rates  
- Comparison of vaccination progress by country and continent  
- Global trends showing correlations between cases, deaths, and vaccination rates  
- Temporal evolution of COVID-19 metrics over time
