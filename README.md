## Project 4 - EDA Budget and Gross Correlation (Python/Pandas)

**Description:**
This project focuses on a **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the movie industry dataset (`movies.csv`) to identify the key financial and audience factors that drive a film's success. The entire cleaning, imputation, and analysis process was executed in **Python** using **Pandas and Seaborn**.

**Objectives:**

- Analyze the correlation between financial metrics (`budget`, `gross_income`) and audience engagement (`votes`, `imdb_score`).
- Visualize the **distribution of key metrics** (e.g., IMDb Score) and compare performance across categorical features (`genre`, `rating`, `country`).
- Identify optimal investment strategies based on genre and rating performance.

**Main Skills Used:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Advanced Data Imputation (Median by Group, Conditional Mode)
- Correlation Analysis (Pearson, Spearman)
- Data Visualization (Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Histograms, Logarithmic Scales)
- Feature Engineering (Numerical Encoding of categorical variables)

**Files Included:**
- 📓 `Movie_Data_EDA_Correlation_Analysis.ipynb` → Full Python notebook with all cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
- 🎬 `movies.csv` → The original dataset used for the project.

**Key Insights:**
- **Financial Drivers:** Correlation analysis confirmed that **Budget** (linear) and **Votes** (rank-based popularity) are the strongest predictors of **Gross Income**.
- **Critical Threshold:** Identification of a **10,000-vote threshold** as the critical point for movies transitioning into higher revenue tiers.
- **Budget Allocation:** Confirmed that **Animation** and **Action** are the highest-budget genres, while **Horror** remains a low-budget niche.
- **Market Viability:** **PG-13** was identified as the most commercially viable rating, consistently showing a high median income and strong potential for blockbusters.

**Description:**
This end-to-end project focuses on creating a **Sales Performance Dashboard** in **Power BI** for the Sales Manager, Steven, based on the **AdventureWorksDW2019** Data Warehouse. The project covered the full lifecycle: from data preparation in **SQL** (ETL) to advanced visualization and KPI tracking.

The main objective was to transform static sales data into an **interactive BI solution** that tracks actual **Sales against Budget**.

**Objectives:**
- Cleanse and transform data from the `AdventureWorksDW2019` database using **T-SQL** to create analysis-ready tables.
- Update historical dates to recent years (2020-2021) for timely reporting.
- Implement a **Star Schema** data model in Power BI, integrating external **Budget** data (`SalesBudget.xlsx`) with core sales data (`FactInternetSales`).
- Create a dynamic dashboard with three pages (**Overview, Customer Details, Product Details**) to meet specific **User Stories** from the Sales Team.
- Track performance against budget using key financial metrics.

**Data Preparation & Modeling:**
- **SQL (T-SQL) Scripts:** Used to cleanse dimensions (`DimDate`, `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`) and the fact table (`FactInternetSales`), ensuring data quality and relevance.
- **Data Model:** Created a Star Schema linking two fact tables (`FACT_InternetSales` and `FACT_Budget`) through shared dimensions (`DIM_Calendar`, `DIM_Customers`, `DIM_Products`).
- **Data Sources:** Combined the large-scale DW data with smaller, manually created budget data.

**Key DAX Measures & KPIs:**
- **`Sales`** (Total Revenue from Internet Sales)
- **`Budget_Amount`** (Total Allocated Budget)
- **`Sales - Budget`** (Performance Variance against Budget)
- **`Sales / Budget_Amount`** (Percentage of Budget Achieved)

## Project 6 - Spotify Data-Driven Industry Analysis (Python)

**Description:** This project performs a comprehensive **strategic analysis of the music industry** from 1952 to 2025 using the Spotify Global Dataset. The study explores how streaming has reshaped music characteristics, genre dominance, and artist success metrics over seven decades. The entire pipeline, from data integration to advanced statistical testing, was developed in **Python**.

**Objectives:**
- Analyze the "Attention Economy" by investigating trends in track duration over time.
- Map the evolution of genre dominance across different industrial eras (Vinyl, CD, Digital, and Streaming).
- Evaluate the correlation between social media following (`followers`) and commercial success (`popularity`).
- Apply **inferential statistics (T-Tests)** to validate industry hypotheses with scientific rigor.

**Main Skills Used:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of custom "Industrial Eras" based on historical market milestones.
- **Statistical Inference:** Hypothesis testing (Independent T-Test) and P-Value interpretation.
- **Advanced Data Manipulation:** Method chaining, data "explosion" for nested genre lists, and deduplication.
- Data Storytelling and Strategic Business Insights.

**Files Included:**
- 📓 `spotify_strategic_analysis.ipynb` → Full Python notebook containing the end-to-end data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis.
- 🎵 `spotify_data clean.csv` → The primary dataset containing track and artist metadata (1952-2025).

**Key Insights:**
